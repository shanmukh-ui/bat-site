    <h2>Batman — Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Batman is a vigilante who operates in Gotham City, driven by discipline,
      intelligence, and an unbreakable sense of justice. Unlike other heroes,
      he does not rely on superpowers, but on preparation, training, and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      After experiencing crime at a young age, he committed his life to
      mastering physical combat, detective skills, and advanced technology.
      His mission is to protect the innocent while striking fear into criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Batman follows a strict moral code. He believes that justice must be
      delivered without becoming the very thing he fights against.

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section class="bio">
    <h2>The Symbol</h2>
    <p>
      Batman is more than a person — he is a symbol. He represents fear for
      criminals and hope for those who cannot protect themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      By becoming something criminals fear, he changes the balance of power.
      The darkness that once protected crime now works against it.

  <!-- GOTHAM -->
  <section id="gotham" class="bio">
    <h2>Gotham City</h2>
    <p>
      Gotham City is a place of towering buildings, deep shadows, and constant
      danger. Crime thrives where corruption and fear control the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Batman does not try to escape Gotham — he embraces it. The city and its
      darkness shape his mission and his methods.
